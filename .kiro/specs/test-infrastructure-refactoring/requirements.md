# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The WebChess project requires a comprehensive refactoring of its Jest-based test suite to achieve 100% passing tests. Currently, 145 out of 638 tests are failing due to API inconsistencies, syntax errors, console error spam, and mismatched expectations between test code and implementation. This feature will systematically fix all test failures, standardize the testing infrastructure, and ensure reliable continuous integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass consistently, so that I can trust the test suite for continuous integration and development confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm test` THEN the system SHALL achieve 100% passing tests with zero failures
2. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL show 0 failed tests and maintain all existing passing functionality
3. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits without hanging or timing out
4. WHEN test results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show clear, actionable output without excessive noise
5. WHEN tests are executed multiple times THEN the system SHALL produce consistent, reproducible results
6. WHEN CI/CD pipeline runs tests THEN the system SHALL pass reliably in automated environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent API responses across all game methods, so that tests can reliably validate game behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any game method returns a result THEN the system SHALL use consistent response structure with `success` boolean property
2. WHEN game state is requested THEN the system SHALL return properties that match test expectations (e.g., `status` vs `gameStatus`)
3. WHEN move validation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with consistent error codes and messages
4. WHEN special moves are executed THEN the system SHALL return consistent response formats for castling, en passant, and promotion
5. WHEN game methods are called with invalid inputs THEN the system SHALL return consistent error response structures
6. WHEN game state changes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent property naming and data types across all methods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error recovery tests to run without console spam, so that test output is clean and actionable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error recovery tests run THEN the system SHALL suppress expected console.error() calls that are part of normal test scenarios
2. WHEN error conditions are tested THEN the system SHALL capture and validate error messages without polluting console output
3. WHEN error recovery mechanisms are tested THEN the system SHALL use proper Jest mocking to prevent console noise
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL only show genuine errors and warnings, not expected error conditions
5. WHEN error handling is validated THEN the system SHALL test error scenarios without affecting test runner output clarity
6. WHEN debugging tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear separation between intentional errors and actual test failures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all syntax errors and parsing issues resolved, so that Jest can execute all test files successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Jest parses test files THEN the system SHALL successfully parse all JavaScript syntax without errors
2. WHEN test files are loaded THEN the system SHALL handle all ES6+ features and module imports correctly
3. WHEN test suites run THEN the system SHALL avoid "unexpected token" errors and parsing failures
4. WHEN test files are structured THEN the system SHALL follow consistent formatting and syntax standards
5. WHEN Jest configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL properly handle all file types and transformations
6. WHEN test files are executed THEN the system SHALL avoid worker process exceptions and retry limit errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests to have realistic expectations, so that they pass consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN the system SHALL use realistic timing thresholds that account for system variability
2. WHEN move validation performance is tested THEN the system SHALL set achievable benchmarks for different hardware configurations
3. WHEN concurrent game performance is tested THEN the system SHALL account for system load and resource availability
4. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL use appropriate measurement techniques and statistical analysis
5. WHEN performance tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on performance expectations and optimization
6. WHEN performance benchmarks are set THEN the system SHALL be achievable on CI/CD environments and developer machines

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage validation, so that I can ensure all critical code paths are tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test coverage is calculated THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 95% code coverage for chess game logic
2. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN the system SHALL identify untested code paths and provide actionable feedback
3. WHEN critical functionality is modified THEN the system SHALL maintain test coverage without regression
4. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL require corresponding test coverage before integration
5. WHEN coverage analysis runs THEN the system SHALL exclude test files and configuration from coverage calculations
6. WHEN coverage thresholds are enforced THEN the system SHALL fail builds that don't meet minimum coverage requirements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized test structure and patterns, so that tests are maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files are organized THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and directory structure
2. WHEN test cases are written THEN the system SHALL use standardized describe/test patterns with clear, descriptive names
3. WHEN test setup is required THEN the system SHALL use consistent beforeEach/afterEach patterns for initialization and cleanup
4. WHEN assertions are made THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Jest matchers with clear, specific expectations
5. WHEN test data is needed THEN the system SHALL use consistent test data patterns and helper functions
6. WHEN tests are documented THEN the system SHALL include clear comments explaining complex test scenarios and chess positions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want browser-based testing capabilities, so that I can test the chess game in-situ within the browser environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser tests are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing `public/test-runner.html` browser test runner functionality
2. WHEN testing in the browser THEN the system SHALL ensure the browser test runner works correctly with the refactored Jest tests
3. WHEN browser tests execute THEN the system SHALL display results in the existing clear, readable format within the browser interface
4. WHEN testing game functionality THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing browser environment, mobile compatibility, and integration test categories
5. WHEN browser and Jest tests run THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency between `tests/browserCompatible.test.js` and browser test runner
6. WHEN browser tests are accessed via `npm run test:browser` THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions to open the test runner
7. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing browser test runner's ability to test DOM elements, mobile features, and game integration
