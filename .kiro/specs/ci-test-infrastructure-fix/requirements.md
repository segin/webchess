# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The WebChess project is experiencing CI failures due to test infrastructure issues including test process leaks, coverage threshold failures, and improper test teardown. This feature addresses these critical testing infrastructure problems to ensure reliable CI/CD pipeline execution.

## Glossary

- **Test_Infrastructure**: The Jest testing framework configuration, test utilities, and test execution environment
- **Coverage_Threshold**: Minimum percentage requirements for code coverage metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- **Process_Leak**: Test processes that fail to exit gracefully due to open handles or active timers
- **Test_Teardown**: Cleanup operations that should occur after test execution to release resources
- **Open_Handle**: Unclosed resources like timers, file handles, or network connections that prevent process exit

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to exit cleanly without process leaks, so that CI builds complete successfully without hanging or force-killing processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite completes execution, THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL terminate all processes gracefully within 5 seconds
2. WHEN tests create timers or async resources, THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL ensure proper cleanup using unref() or explicit cleanup
3. IF open handles are detected, THEN THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL provide clear diagnostic information about the source
4. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL implement proper beforeEach and afterEach hooks for resource management
5. WHEN running with --detectOpenHandles flag, THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL identify and report any resource leaks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code coverage thresholds to be met, so that the CI build passes and code quality standards are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL achieve minimum 95% coverage for statements, branches, functions, and lines in chessGame.js
2. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL achieve minimum 95% coverage for statements, branches, functions, and lines in gameState.js
3. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL achieve minimum 95% coverage for statements, branches, functions, and lines in errorHandler.js
4. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL achieve minimum 80% coverage for statements, branches, and lines in server/index.js
5. WHEN coverage thresholds are not met, THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL provide specific line numbers and uncovered code paths

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the server entry point, so that server initialization and WebSocket handling are properly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL create tests for server startup and initialization in index.js
2. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL create tests for WebSocket connection handling and event routing
3. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL create tests for HTTP endpoint responses and health checks
4. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL create tests for error handling in server initialization
5. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL mock external dependencies to enable isolated server testing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved test utilities and patterns, so that tests are more maintainable and follow consistent patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL provide centralized test utilities for common setup and teardown operations
2. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL implement consistent mocking patterns for WebSocket and HTTP dependencies
3. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL provide helper functions for creating test game states and board positions
4. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL ensure all async operations in tests are properly awaited or handled
5. WHERE tests require cleanup, THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL provide standardized cleanup utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Jest configuration optimized for the WebChess project, so that tests run efficiently and reliably in CI environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL configure Jest with appropriate timeout settings for CI environments
2. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL implement proper test isolation to prevent test interference
3. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL configure coverage collection to exclude unnecessary files and directories
4. THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL set up proper test environment variables and global configurations
5. WHEN tests fail due to timing issues, THE Test_Infrastructure SHALL provide increased timeout tolerances for CI
