# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The WebChess project has 54 test units across multiple test files that need to be normalized to use the current internal API consistently. Many tests were written against older API patterns or use inconsistent approaches to calling game methods, validating responses, and accessing game state. This feature will systematically update all unit tests to use the standardized API patterns, ensuring consistent test structure and reliable validation of game functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unit tests to use consistent API calling patterns, so that tests accurately reflect the current implementation and provide reliable validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any test calls game methods THEN the system SHALL use the current standardized method signatures and parameter formats
2. WHEN tests validate move responses THEN the system SHALL expect the current response structure with `success` boolean and consistent data properties
3. WHEN tests access game state THEN the system SHALL use the current property names (`gameStatus` vs `status`, etc.) as implemented in the codebase
4. WHEN tests call makeMove THEN the system SHALL use the current move object format with `from`, `to`, and optional `promotion` properties
5. WHEN tests validate error responses THEN the system SHALL expect the current error response structure with consistent error codes and messages
6. WHEN tests check game state properties THEN the system SHALL access properties using the actual implementation property names

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test utility functions to use the current API patterns, so that test helpers provide consistent and accurate validation across all test files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test utilities validate game state THEN the system SHALL check properties that actually exist in the current implementation
2. WHEN test utilities create test moves THEN the system SHALL use the current move object structure and validation patterns
3. WHEN test utilities validate responses THEN the system SHALL check for the current response format with proper success/error handling
4. WHEN test utilities access board state THEN the system SHALL use the current board representation and piece object structure
5. WHEN test utilities validate special moves THEN the system SHALL check for current castling, en passant, and promotion response formats
6. WHEN test utilities create fresh games THEN the system SHALL initialize games using the current constructor and initialization patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling validation across all tests, so that error scenarios are properly tested against the current error response patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests validate invalid moves THEN the system SHALL expect error responses in the current format with specific error codes
2. WHEN tests check boundary conditions THEN the system SHALL validate errors using the current error message patterns and structures
3. WHEN tests validate input validation THEN the system SHALL expect the current error response format for malformed inputs
4. WHEN tests check game state errors THEN the system SHALL validate errors using the current game state error patterns
5. WHEN tests validate chess rule violations THEN the system SHALL expect error responses that match the current rule validation implementation
6. WHEN tests check special move errors THEN the system SHALL validate castling, en passant, and promotion errors using current error formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all piece movement tests to use consistent validation patterns, so that piece behavior is accurately tested against the current movement validation implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pawn movement tests run THEN the system SHALL validate moves using the current pawn movement API and response format
2. WHEN knight movement tests run THEN the system SHALL validate L-shaped moves using the current knight validation implementation
3. WHEN rook movement tests run THEN the system SHALL validate horizontal/vertical moves using the current rook movement API
4. WHEN bishop movement tests run THEN the system SHALL validate diagonal moves using the current bishop movement implementation
5. WHEN queen movement tests run THEN the system SHALL validate combined movement using the current queen movement API
6. WHEN king movement tests run THEN the system SHALL validate single-square moves using the current king movement implementation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all special move tests to use current API patterns, so that castling, en passant, and promotion are accurately tested against the current implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN castling tests run THEN the system SHALL validate castling moves using the current castling API and response format
2. WHEN en passant tests run THEN the system SHALL validate en passant captures using the current en passant implementation
3. WHEN pawn promotion tests run THEN the system SHALL validate promotion using the current promotion API and piece selection format
4. WHEN special move validation tests run THEN the system SHALL check special move requirements using current validation patterns
5. WHEN special move error tests run THEN the system SHALL validate special move errors using current error response formats
6. WHEN special move state updates run THEN the system SHALL verify state changes using current game state property names

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all game state validation tests to use current property names and structures, so that game state management is accurately tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests validate current turn THEN the system SHALL check the `currentTurn` property as implemented in the current API
2. WHEN tests validate game status THEN the system SHALL check the `gameStatus` property using the current status values
3. WHEN tests validate move history THEN the system SHALL check the `moveHistory` property using the current move record structure
4. WHEN tests validate castling rights THEN the system SHALL check the `castlingRights` property using the current rights object structure
5. WHEN tests validate en passant target THEN the system SHALL check the `enPassantTarget` property using the current target format
6. WHEN tests validate check status THEN the system SHALL check the `inCheck` property and related check detection properties

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to follow consistent naming and organization patterns, so that tests are maintainable and follow project standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files are organized THEN the system SHALL follow consistent describe block naming with clear component and method identification
2. WHEN test cases are named THEN the system SHALL use descriptive names that clearly indicate the scenario being tested
3. WHEN test setup is implemented THEN the system SHALL use consistent beforeEach patterns for game initialization and cleanup
4. WHEN test assertions are made THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Jest matchers with clear, specific expectations
5. WHEN test data is used THEN the system SHALL use consistent test data patterns and avoid hardcoded values where possible
6. WHEN test utilities are called THEN the system SHALL use standardized utility function names and calling patterns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive coverage of all 54+ test units with normalized API usage, so that every test accurately validates the current implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all test units are reviewed THEN the system SHALL identify and update every test that uses outdated API patterns
2. WHEN test normalization is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure all 54+ test units use current API calling patterns
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL achieve consistent test results with proper validation of current implementation
4. WHEN new test patterns are established THEN the system SHALL provide examples for future test development
5. WHEN test coverage is validated THEN the system SHALL ensure all critical game functionality is tested using current API patterns
6. WHEN test maintenance is considered THEN the system SHALL establish patterns that will remain consistent with future API evolution
