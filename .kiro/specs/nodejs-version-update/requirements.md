# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for updating the minimum Node.js version from the current version (18+) to Node.js 22.19 across all WebChess project configuration files and documentation. This update ensures the project uses the latest LTS features and security improvements while maintaining compatibility across development, testing, and deployment environments.

## Glossary

- **WebChess_System**: The complete WebChess application including server, client, and deployment components
- **Configuration_Files**: Files that specify Node.js version requirements including package.json, Dockerfile, GitHub Actions workflows, and documentation
- **Deployment_Environment**: Production, staging, and development environments where WebChess runs
- **CI_Pipeline**: Continuous Integration pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to specify Node.js 22.19 as the minimum version, so that I can use the latest LTS features and security improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating package.json engines field, THE WebChess_System SHALL specify Node.js version 22.19 as the minimum requirement
2. WHEN developers run npm install, THE WebChess_System SHALL validate Node.js version compatibility against 22.19
3. THE WebChess_System SHALL document the Node.js 22.19 requirement in all relevant documentation files
4. THE WebChess_System SHALL update all configuration files to reference Node.js 22.19 consistently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all Docker configurations to use Node.js 22.19, so that containerized deployments run on the correct Node.js version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Docker images, THE WebChess_System SHALL use Node.js 22.19 base image
2. THE WebChess_System SHALL update Dockerfile to reference node:22.19-alpine base image
3. WHEN running in production containers, THE WebChess_System SHALL execute on Node.js 22.19 runtime
4. THE WebChess_System SHALL maintain multi-stage build compatibility with Node.js 22.19

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CI/CD maintainer, I want GitHub Actions workflows to test against Node.js 22.19, so that automated testing validates compatibility with the target runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running CI tests, THE CI_Pipeline SHALL execute tests on Node.js 22.19
2. THE CI_Pipeline SHALL update setup-node actions to use Node.js 22.19
3. WHEN performing health checks, THE CI_Pipeline SHALL validate application startup on Node.js 22.19
4. THE CI_Pipeline SHALL maintain backward compatibility testing if required

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want installation documentation to reflect Node.js 22.19 requirements, so that deployment instructions are accurate and current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN following installation guides, THE WebChess_System SHALL specify Node.js 22.19 as the required version
2. THE WebChess_System SHALL update README.md to reflect Node.js 22.19 requirement
3. THE WebChess_System SHALL update DEBIAN_INSTALL.md with correct Node.js installation commands for version 22.19
4. THE WebChess_System SHALL update deployment documentation to reference Node.js 22.19

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want development environment setup to be consistent with Node.js 22.19, so that local development matches production requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development environment, THE WebChess_System SHALL validate Node.js 22.19 installation
2. THE WebChess_System SHALL provide clear error messages if Node.js version is below 22.19
3. WHEN running development scripts, THE WebChess_System SHALL execute successfully on Node.js 22.19
4. THE WebChess_System SHALL maintain compatibility with existing npm scripts and development tools
