# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves consolidating all chess game related tests from multiple separate test files into a single comprehensive `chessGame.test.js` file. The goal is to improve test organization, reduce duplication, and create a centralized location for all chess game logic tests while maintaining complete test coverage and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all chess game tests consolidated into a single file, so that I can easily find and maintain all chess game related tests in one location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the test directory THEN all chess game related tests SHALL be located in `tests/chessGame.test.js`
2. WHEN I run the test suite THEN all migrated tests SHALL continue to pass with identical functionality
3. WHEN I look for chess game tests THEN I SHALL NOT find them scattered across multiple separate files
4. WHEN tests are migrated THEN the original test files SHALL be deleted only after all tests are successfully moved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests migrated systematically one at a time, so that I can ensure no tests are lost and maintain test integrity throughout the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating tests THEN each test SHALL be moved individually from source to destination file
2. WHEN a test is migrated THEN it SHALL be deleted from the original file immediately after successful migration
3. WHEN all tests from a file are migrated THEN the empty source file SHALL be deleted
4. WHEN migration occurs THEN test functionality and assertions SHALL remain identical

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify all chess game related test files, so that I can ensure complete consolidation without missing any relevant tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying test files THEN all files containing chess game logic tests SHALL be catalogued
2. WHEN examining test files THEN piece movement, game state, special moves, and rule validation tests SHALL be identified
3. WHEN cataloguing files THEN tests for pawn, rook, bishop, knight, queen, king movement SHALL be included
4. WHEN reviewing files THEN castling, en passant, promotion, check, checkmate, and stalemate tests SHALL be included

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the consolidated test file to be well-organized, so that tests are easy to navigate and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are consolidated THEN they SHALL be organized into logical describe blocks by functionality
2. WHEN viewing the consolidated file THEN related tests SHALL be grouped together (e.g., all pawn tests, all castling tests)
3. WHEN tests are migrated THEN existing test structure and naming SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the file SHALL maintain clear separation between different test categories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure no test coverage is lost during consolidation, so that the chess game remains fully tested after the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is complete THEN test coverage SHALL be identical to pre-migration coverage
2. WHEN tests are moved THEN all test assertions and expectations SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN consolidation occurs THEN no duplicate tests SHALL be created in the destination file
4. WHEN the process completes THEN `npm test` SHALL pass with the same number of successful tests
