## Introduction

This feature implements proper algebraic chess notation for WebChess, replacing the current coordinate-based notation system with standard algebraic notation that follows international chess standards. The system will generate notation like "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. d4 exd4 4. e5 Ne4 5. Qxd4 d5 6. exd6 e.p." with mandatory special move markers.

## Glossary

- **Algebraic_Notation_System**: The chess move notation system that uses piece symbols, destination squares, and special markers to represent moves
- **Move_Generator**: The system component responsible for converting move coordinates to algebraic notation
- **Special_Move_Marker**: Mandatory notation suffixes for special moves (e.p., O-O, O-O-O, =Q, +, #)
- **Piece_Symbol**: Standard chess piece abbreviations (K=King, Q=Queen, R=Rook, B=Bishop, N=Knight, no symbol for pawn)
- **Disambiguation**: Additional notation required when multiple pieces of the same type can move to the same square
- **Move_History_Display**: The formatted sequence of moves shown to players in proper algebraic notation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to see moves displayed in standard algebraic notation, so that I can easily read and understand the game progression using familiar chess notation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pawn moves, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL generate notation without piece symbol (e.g., "e4", "d5")
2. WHEN a piece other than pawn moves, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL generate notation with piece symbol (e.g., "Nf3", "Bc4", "Qh5")
3. WHEN a capture occurs, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL include "x" symbol (e.g., "Nxe4", "exd5")
4. WHEN a pawn captures, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL include the file of origin (e.g., "exd5", "fxg6")
5. THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL use standard piece symbols: K, Q, R, B, N (no symbol for pawns)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want special moves to be clearly marked with mandatory notation, so that I can immediately identify castling, en passant, and other special moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN kingside castling occurs, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL generate "O-O" notation
2. WHEN queenside castling occurs, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL generate "O-O-O" notation
3. WHEN en passant capture occurs, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL append " e.p." to the move notation
4. WHEN pawn promotion occurs, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL append "=Q", "=R", "=B", or "=N" based on promotion choice
5. THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL make special move markers mandatory and non-optional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want check and checkmate to be clearly indicated in notation, so that I can see the game state at each move.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a move puts the opponent in check, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL append "+" to the move notation
2. WHEN a move results in checkmate, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL append "#" to the move notation
3. WHEN multiple check/mate conditions exist, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL prioritize "#" over "+"
4. THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL validate check/mate status before adding notation markers
5. THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL ensure check/mate markers are always accurate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want ambiguous moves to be properly disambiguated, so that I can understand exactly which piece moved when multiple pieces could reach the same square.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple pieces of same type can move to same square, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL add file disambiguation (e.g., "Nbd2", "Rad1")
2. WHEN file disambiguation is insufficient, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL add rank disambiguation (e.g., "N1f3", "R1a3")
3. WHEN both file and rank are needed, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL use full square disambiguation (e.g., "Qd1d4")
4. THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL use minimal disambiguation necessary for clarity
5. THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL validate disambiguation accuracy for all ambiguous moves

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the complete game to be displayed in proper move sequence format, so that I can review the entire game in standard chess notation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Move_History_Display SHALL format moves as "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Bc5"
2. THE Move_History_Display SHALL number moves starting from 1 for white's first move
3. THE Move_History_Display SHALL group white and black moves together with same move number
4. WHEN displaying partial sequences, THE Move_History_Display SHALL maintain proper move numbering
5. THE Move_History_Display SHALL handle continuation notation for games starting mid-sequence

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the notation system to be backward compatible, so that existing game data and APIs continue to function while supporting the new notation format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL maintain existing coordinate-based move input format
2. THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL generate algebraic notation for display without breaking existing functionality
3. WHEN move history is requested, THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL provide both coordinate and algebraic formats
4. THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL preserve all existing game state and move validation logic
5. THE Algebraic_Notation_System SHALL ensure no breaking changes to current API contracts
