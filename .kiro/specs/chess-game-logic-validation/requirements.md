# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The WebChess system requires comprehensive validation and enhancement of its chess game logic to ensure 100% compliance with official chess rules, robust error handling, and bulletproof game state management. This feature will strengthen the existing chess implementation by adding comprehensive validation layers, edge case handling, and advanced rule enforcement to prevent any illegal moves or game states.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want all chess moves to be validated against official FIDE rules, so that I can trust the game follows proper chess regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player attempts any piece movement THEN the system SHALL validate the move against official chess piece movement rules
2. WHEN a pawn attempts to move THEN the system SHALL enforce proper pawn movement patterns including initial two-square moves, diagonal captures only, and en passant rules
3. WHEN a knight attempts to move THEN the system SHALL validate the L-shaped movement pattern (2+1 or 1+2 squares) with no path obstruction checks
4. WHEN a rook attempts to move THEN the system SHALL validate horizontal or vertical movement with clear path requirements
5. WHEN a bishop attempts to move THEN the system SHALL validate diagonal movement with clear path requirements
6. WHEN a queen attempts to move THEN the system SHALL validate combined rook and bishop movement patterns
7. WHEN a king attempts to move THEN the system SHALL validate single-square movement in any direction or castling conditions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want special chess moves to work correctly, so that I can use advanced chess strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conditions are met for castling THEN the system SHALL allow kingside and queenside castling moves
2. WHEN castling is attempted but king has moved THEN the system SHALL reject the castling move
3. WHEN castling is attempted but rook has moved THEN the system SHALL reject the castling move
4. WHEN castling is attempted through check THEN the system SHALL reject the castling move
5. WHEN castling is attempted while in check THEN the system SHALL reject the castling move
6. WHEN castling is attempted with pieces blocking the path THEN the system SHALL reject the castling move
7. WHEN a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board THEN the system SHALL enforce pawn promotion to queen, rook, bishop, or knight
8. WHEN en passant conditions are met THEN the system SHALL allow the en passant capture and remove the captured pawn

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want check and checkmate to be detected accurately, so that games end properly according to chess rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a king is under attack THEN the system SHALL detect and indicate check status
2. WHEN a player attempts a move that would put their own king in check THEN the system SHALL reject the move
3. WHEN a king is in check and has no legal moves to escape THEN the system SHALL detect checkmate
4. WHEN checkmate is detected THEN the system SHALL end the game and declare the winner
5. WHEN a player has no legal moves but is not in check THEN the system SHALL detect stalemate
6. WHEN stalemate is detected THEN the system SHALL end the game as a draw
7. WHEN check is resolved by blocking, capturing, or moving the king THEN the system SHALL clear the check status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the game to handle edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully, so that the game remains stable and provides clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid coordinates are provided THEN the system SHALL reject the move with appropriate error message
2. WHEN attempting to move from an empty square THEN the system SHALL reject the move with appropriate error message
3. WHEN attempting to move opponent's piece THEN the system SHALL reject the move with appropriate error message
4. WHEN attempting to capture own piece THEN the system SHALL reject the move with appropriate error message
5. WHEN game is already ended THEN the system SHALL reject any further move attempts
6. WHEN move format is malformed THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the game state to be consistent and accurate at all times, so that I can trust the game's integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any move is made THEN the system SHALL update the board state accurately
2. WHEN any move is made THEN the system SHALL switch turns correctly between white and black
3. WHEN any move is made THEN the system SHALL update move history with complete move information
4. WHEN castling rights change THEN the system SHALL update castling permissions accurately
5. WHEN en passant target changes THEN the system SHALL update en passant state correctly
6. WHEN game ends THEN the system SHALL set final game status and winner information
7. WHEN game state is requested THEN the system SHALL return complete and accurate current state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all chess rules, so that I can be confident in the game logic reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL have test coverage for all piece movement patterns
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL have test coverage for all special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL have test coverage for all check and checkmate scenarios
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL have test coverage for all edge cases and error conditions
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL have test coverage for game state management
6. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 95% code coverage for chess game logic
7. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL validate complex game scenarios and rule interactions
