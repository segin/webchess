- Game state tests (check, checkmate, stalemate detection)
- Error handling and recovery tests

#### Integration Tests (2 files)
- Complete game flow scenarios
- Server-client integration testing
- Multi-component interaction validation

- DOM interaction and responsive design tests

## Continuous Integration Support

The test infrastructure now fully supports reliable CI/CD workflows through:

### 1. Deterministic Test Execution
- All tests produce consistent results across environments
- Proper test isolation prevents state leakage between tests
- Error suppression eliminates console spam without hiding real issues

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Realistic performance thresholds account for CI environment limitations
- Test execution times are optimized for parallel execution
- Memory usage is managed to prevent resource exhaustion

### 3. Coverage Validation
- Automated coverage reporting with 95% threshold enforcement
- Build failures when coverage requirements aren't met
- Exclusion of appropriate files from coverage calculations

### 4. Error Management
- Comprehensive error suppression for expected error conditions
- Clear separation between intentional errors and actual test failures
- Structured error reporting with actionable feedback

## Developer Experience Improvements

### 1. Documentation Accessibility
- Three comprehensive guides covering all aspects of test maintenance
- Quick reference materials for common problems
- Step-by-step procedures for adding new tests

### 2. Automated Validation
