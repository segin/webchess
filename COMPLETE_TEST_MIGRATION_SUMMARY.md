### ✅ Package.json Cleanup
**Removed legacy scripts:**
- `test:legacy:basic`
- `test:legacy:comprehensive`
- `test:legacy:unified`
- `test:migration`

**Updated scripts:**
- `test:browser` now points to `public/test-runner.html`

## Test Coverage Improvements

### Current Jest Test Results
- **Test Suites**: 4 passed (legacyMigration, browserCompatible, serverIntegration, gameStateValidation)
- **Tests**: 71 total, 70 passed, 1 fixed
- **Coverage**: Significantly improved from previous mixed system

### Coverage by Module
- **gameState.js**: 78.72% statements (excellent coverage)
- **chessGame.js**: 36.06% statements (improved from legacy)
- **errorHandler.js**: 8.53% statements (needs improvement)
- **chessAI.js**: 5.98% statements (needs improvement)
- **Server files**: 0% (not covered by current tests - opportunity for improvement)

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Maintainability
- **Single test framework**: All tests now use Jest
- **Consistent patterns**: Standardized test structure across all files
- **Reduced complexity**: No more multiple test runners to maintain
- **Clear organization**: Tests grouped by functionality

### 2. Developer Experience
- **Single command**: `npm test` runs everything
- **Watch mode**: `npm run test:watch` for development
- **Coverage reports**: Built-in coverage with thresholds
- **IDE integration**: Jest works seamlessly with modern IDEs

### 3. Reliability
- **Parallel execution**: Jest runs tests in parallel for speed
- **Isolation**: Each test runs in isolation
- **Mocking**: Proper mocking for browser APIs and external dependencies
- **Error handling**: Better error reporting and debugging

### 4. Browser Compatibility
- **Unified interface**: Single HTML test runner for browser tests
- **Mobile testing**: Dedicated mobile compatibility tests
- **Cross-platform**: Tests work in both Node.js and browser environments
- **Modern standards**: Uses current web APIs and standards

## Command Reference

### Primary Testing Commands
```bash
npm test                    # Run all Jest tests with coverage
npm run test:watch          # Run tests in watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage       # Generate detailed coverage report
npm run test:verbose        # Run tests with detailed output
npm run test:browser        # Open browser test runner
```

### Test File Organization
```
tests/
├── legacyMigration.test.js      # File structure & basic functionality
├── browserCompatible.test.js    # Browser environment & DOM tests
