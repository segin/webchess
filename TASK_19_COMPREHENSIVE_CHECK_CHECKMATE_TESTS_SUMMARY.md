- Boundary condition testing

✅ **Pawn Check Detection**
- Diagonal attack patterns for both colors
- Direction-specific validation (white vs black pawns)
- Forward movement exclusion (pawns don't attack forward)

✅ **King Check Detection**
- Adjacent square attacks in all 8 directions
- Single-square attack validation

#### 2. Double and Multiple Check Detection
✅ **Double Check Scenarios**
- Rook and bishop combination attacks
- Triple check detection (theoretical scenarios)
- Proper categorization as "double_check"

✅ **Discovered Check Detection**
- Moving blocking pieces to reveal attacks
- Complex piece interaction scenarios

#### 3. Basic Checkmate Patterns
✅ **Classic Checkmate Scenarios**
- Back rank mate with rook
- Simple queen checkmate
- Rook and king mate
- Ladder mate with two rooks

✅ **Piece-Specific Checkmate Patterns**
- Queen and king combinations
- Two rook combinations
- Various attacking piece configurations

#### 4. Complex Checkmate Scenarios
✅ **Advanced Checkmate Patterns**
- Fool's mate (fastest checkmate)
- Scholar's mate pattern
- Anastasia's mate pattern
- Arabian mate (rook and knight)

✅ **Multiple Piece Involvement**
- Complex positions with multiple attacking pieces
- Pinned piece scenarios in checkmate
- Coordinated piece attacks

#### 5. Stalemate Detection and Distinction
✅ **Classic Stalemate Positions**
- King trapped but not in check
- King and pawn vs king stalemate
- Multiple piece stalemate scenarios

✅ **Checkmate vs Stalemate Distinction**
- Clear differentiation between the two conditions
- Proper game ending logic
- Winner determination accuracy

#### 6. Check Resolution Validation
✅ **Resolution Methods**
- Check resolution by blocking
- Check resolution by capturing attacking piece
- Check resolution by king movement
- Validation of legal resolution moves

✅ **Complex Resolution Scenarios**
- Multiple attack resolution
- Pinned piece limitations
- Double check resolution (king-only moves)

#### 7. Edge Cases and Complex Scenarios
✅ **Board Edge Conditions**
- Check detection at board edges
- Corner position scenarios
- Boundary condition handling

✅ **Multiple Attacker Scenarios**
- Multiple potential attackers with only one valid
- Complex attack pattern validation
- Path obstruction in multi-piece scenarios

✅ **Discovered Check Scenarios**
- Moving pieces to reveal attacks
- Complex piece interaction validation

#### 8. Performance and Efficiency Tests
✅ **Performance Validation**
- Check detection timing (< 50ms target)
- Checkmate detection timing (< 100ms target)
- Complex position handling efficiency

✅ **Memory Usage Testing**
- Efficient data structure usage
- No memory leaks in complex scenarios

#### 9. Game State Integration
✅ **Status Updates**
- Correct game status for check conditions
- Proper checkmate winner declaration
- Stalemate draw condition handling

✅ **State Consistency**
- Check details inclusion in game state
- Proper turn management
- Move history preservation

## Technical Implementation Features

### Test Structure
- **Modular Organization**: Tests organized by functionality and complexity
- **Descriptive Naming**: Clear test names explaining scenarios
