- **Total Tests:** 2,176 (2,173 passed, 3 failed)
- **Execution Time:** ~116-180 seconds
- **Failed Test Suite:** `chessGameUltimateCoverage.test.js` (3 failing tests)

### Coverage Summary

- **Overall Functions:** 84.67% (210/248)
- **Overall Lines:** 87.15% (1751/2009)

### Module-Specific Coverage

## Files Identified for Consolidation

The following `chessGame*.test.js` files will be consolidated into `chessGame.test.js`:

1. **chessGameAdvancedCoverage.test.js** - Advanced coverage tests
2. **chessGameCoverageExpansion.test.js** - Coverage expansion tests  
3. **chessGameFinalCoverage.test.js** - Final coverage tests and edge cases
4. **chessGameUltimateCoverage.test.js** - Ultimate coverage tests (currently has 3 failing tests)

## Validation Criteria

After migration completion, the following metrics should be maintained:
- Total test count should remain 2,176 tests
- Overall coverage percentages should remain identical
- All currently passing tests (2,173) should continue to pass
- Test execution should complete successfully
- No duplicate tests should exist in the consolidated file

## Notes

- The 3 failing tests in `chessGameUltimateCoverage.test.js` are related to move notation generation
- These failures are pre-existing and not related to the consolidation process
- Test backup created at `tests_backup_20251001_022303/` for rollback if needed
- Migration should be performed incrementally with validation after each file
