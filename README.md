## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Deployment

### Quick System Installation

**For Debian/Ubuntu systems:**

```bash
# One-command installation
git clone https://github.com/segin/webchess.git
cd webchess
sudo ./deployment/install.sh
```

See [DEBIAN_INSTALL.md](DEBIAN_INSTALL.md) for detailed Debian/Ubuntu instructions.

**For other Unix/Linux systems with systemd:**

```bash
# Clone and install as system service
git clone https://github.com/segin/webchess.git
cd webchess
sudo ./deployment/install.sh
```

This will:
- Create a `webchess` system user
- Install the app to `/opt/webchess`
- Set up a systemd service
- Start the service automatically

### Configuration

The server listens on configurable host/port:

```bash
# Environment variables
export PORT=3000          # Default: 3000
export HOST=localhost      # Default: localhost
export NODE_ENV=production

# Start server
npm start
```

### Nginx Integration

Set up WebChess on a subdomain (works with existing sites):

```bash
# Automated setup for subdomain
sudo deployment/setup-nginx.sh -d yourdomain.com

# Custom subdomain
sudo deployment/setup-nginx.sh -d yourdomain.com -s games
```

This creates `chess.yourdomain.com` (or custom subdomain) without affecting existing nginx sites.

### Service Management

```bash
# Service commands
sudo systemctl start webchess
sudo systemctl stop webchess
sudo systemctl restart webchess
sudo systemctl status webchess

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u webchess -f
```

For detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## CI/CD & Automation

WebChess includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:

### 🔄 Continuous Integration
